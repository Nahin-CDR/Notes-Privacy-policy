# Privacy Policy for Notes App

Our Notes app is designed to provide a secure and private space for you to store your notes. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information in the app.
<br>
<br>
## Information Collection and Use
Our Notes app collects and stores the notes that you create within the app on your device's local database. The app does not collect any personal information from you, such as your name or email address, and does not require an internet connection to function.
<br>
<br>
## Data Protection
We take the protection of your data very seriously. Your notes are stored on your device's local database, which means that only you have access to them. We do not store your notes on our servers, and we do not share your data with any third parties.
<br>
<br>
## Third-Party Services
Our Notes app does not integrate with any third-party services or apps, so your data is not shared with any external providers.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to our policies, we will notify you within the app or by email.
